            <p> Plant pathology is the study of the organisms and of the environmental factors that cause disease in plants; of the mechanisms by which these factors induce disease in plants; and of the methods of preventing or controlling disease and reducing the damage it causes. Plant pathology is for plants largely what medicine is for humans and veterinary medicine is for animals.</p>
      <br>      
            <p>Plant pathology is an integrative science and profession that uses and combines the basic knowledge of botany, mycology, bacteriology, virology, nematology, plant anatomy, plant physiology, genetics, molecular biology and genetic engineering, biochemistry, horticulture, agronomy, tissue culture, soil science, forestry, chemistry, physics, meteorology, and many other branches of science.</p> <br>
            <p> As a science, plant pathology tries to increase our knowledge about plant diseases. At the same time, plant pathology tries to develop methods, equipment, and materials through which plant diseases can be avoided or controlled. </p> <br>

            <ol>
              <li><b>Plant Pathology</b> is defined as the study of the organisms and environmental conditions that cause disease in plants, the mechanisms by which this occurs, the interactions between these causal agents and the plant (effects on plant growth, yield and quality), and the methods of managing or controlling plant disease. It also interfaces knowledge from other scientific fields such as mycology, microbiology, virology, biochemistry, bio-informatics, etc. <a href= "https://www.nda.agric.za/docs/ET/plant_pathology.htm"  target=”blank”>Source</a> </li>
              <li><b>A Pathogens</b> is a biological agent that causes disease to its host. </li>
              <li><b>Pathogenesis</b> is the step by step development of a disease due to a series of changes in the structure or function of a plant, caused by a chemical or physical agent. </li> 
              <li>A <b>Host</b> is any organism that harbor another organism is called a host. </li>
              <li><b>Symptoms</b> are expression of the disease caused by the manifestation of the physiological reaction of the plant due to harmful activity of the pathogen. </li>
              <li><b>Parasites</b> lives in a close relationship with another organism called its host and causes it harm. The parasite is depemdent on its host for its live function. </li>
              <li><b>Pathogenicity</b> is the ability of an pathogen to cause disease or damage to its host. </li>
              <li><b>Virulence</b> is the measure of the pathogenicity of an organism.</li>
              <li><b>Infection</b> is the invasion of the host by microorganisms, which then multiply in close association with the host's tissues. Infection is distinguished from disease, <a href="  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8526/" target="blank"> NCBI </a> </li> <br>

          <section id="epidemiology"> <header>Epidemiology, Pathogen and Life Cycle </header>
            <br>
            <p>When a pathogen spreads to and affects many individuals within a population over a relatively
      large area and within a relatively short time, the phenomenon is called an epidemic. </p>
      <p>An epidemic has been defined as any increase of disease in a population.
      The study of epidemics and of the factors that influence them is called epidemiology.</p>
      
      <p>Epidemiology or epiphytology is the study of the outbreak of disease, its course, intensity, cause and effects and the various factors governing it. </p>
      <p>Based on the occurrence and geographical distribution they are classified as follows:</p> <br>
      
      <h3>Endemic or Enphytotic</h3>
            <br>
      <p>When a disease is more or less constantly occurring year after year in a moderate to severe form in a country or locality then it is called as endemic disease.</p><br>
      
      <h3>Epidemic or Epiphytotic</h3> <br>
      <p>It is a sudden outbreak of a disease periodically over a widespread area in a devastatingly severe form causing severe losses or complete destruction. <br>
      Certain disease are endemic in one area and become epidemic in another area. E.g. Citrus canker is endemic in Asia but epidemic in the introduced place, Florida (U.S.A). </p><br>
      
      <h3>Pandemic</h3><br>
      <p>When an epidemic disease spreads over continents or subcontinents and involves mass mortality it is considered as pandemic. The outbreak of black stem rust of wheat in India during 1947 is best example for a pandemic disease.</p><br>
      
      <h3>Sporadic</h3><br>
      <p>Diseases which occur at irregular intervals over limited areas or locations are called sporadic. They occur relatively in few instances. E.g.  Fusarium wilt of cotton (Fusarium oxysporum) </p> <br>
      
      <p>For a disease to occur the following 3 factors must be present:</p><br>
      <ol>
          <li>A susceptible host</li>
          <li>A virulent Pathogen</li>
          <li>A suitable environment.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is known as the disease triangle.</p>

            <br>
            <ol>
              <li> The suspected causal agent (bacterium or other microorganism) must be present in every diseased organism (e.g., a plant) examined.</li>
              <li>The suspected causal agent (bacterium, etc.) must be isolated from the diseased host organism (plant) and grown in pure culture.</li>
              <li>When a pure culture of the suspected causal agent is inoculated into a healthy susceptible host (plant), the host must reproduce the specific disease.</li>
              <li>The same causal agent must be recovered again from the experimentally inoculated and infected host, i.e., the recovered agent must have the same characteristics as the organism in step 2.</li>

          <section id="plant_disease_control"> <header>General Principle of Plant Disease Control </header>
            <br>
            <p>Methods for plant diseases control were first classified by Whetzel (1929) into exclusion, eradication, protection and immunization. Further advances in plant pathology led to development of newer methods. Two more principles - avoidance and therapy were created (NAS, 1968).</p><br>
            
      <h3>Avoidance</h3> <br>
      <p>It involves avoiding disease by planting at time when, or in areas where inoculums is absent or ineffective due to environmental conditions. The major aim is to enable the host to avoid contact with the pathogen or to ensure that the susceptible stage of the plant does not coincide with favourable conditions for the pathogen. </p> <br>
      <p>The main practices under avoidance are choice of geographical area, selection of the field, choice of sowing/ planting time, selection of seed and planting material, short duration / disease escaping varieties and modification of agronomic/cultural practices. The potato cultivation at high altitude is relatively free from viruses.</p><br>
            
      <h3>Exclusion</h3> <br>
      <p>It means preventing the inoculums from entering or establishing in a field or area where it does not exist. Seed certification, crop inspection, eradication of inoculums and / or insect vectors, and quarantine measures are some of the means of preventing the spread for pathogens.</p> <br>
            
      <h3>Eradication</h3> <br>
      <p>The process of reducing, inactivating, eliminating or destroying inoculums at the source, either from a region or from an individual plant in which it is already established is termed as eradication. Eradication involves eliminating the pathogen from infested areas; the magnitude of the operation involved may vary considerably.</p> <br>
            
      <h3>Protection</h3> <br>
      <p>The protection of infection courts against the inoculums of many fast spreading infectious pathogen, brought by wind from neighboring fields or any other distant place of survival.</p> <br>
      <p>Measures are necessary to protect host plants from invading inoculums. It can be achieved by creating toxic barrier between the plant surface and the inoculums. Methods employed to achieve such results are chemical sprays, dusts, modification of environment, and modification of host nutrition.</p><br>
            
      <h3>Host resistance</h3><br>
      <p>It utilizes in – built mechanism to resist various activities of pathogen. The infection or subsequent damage by pathogen can be rendered ineffective through genetic manipulation or by chemotherapy.<br>
      The classical breeding techniques include selection, mutation and hybridization. Use of biotechnological tools such as tissue culture, genetic engineering and protoplast fusion are being used to develop resistant cultivars of various economically important crops.</p> <br>
            
      <h3>Therapy</h3> <br>
      <p>It is the treatment of infected host plant, which is attempted in case of economically important horticulture plants. As a principle of plant disease control, it provides an opportunity to cure or rejuvenate the diseased host plant by use of physical or chemical agents. The first five of these principles are mainly preventive (prophylactic) and constitute the major components of plant disease management. They are applied to the population of plants before infection takes place. Therapy is a curative procedure and is applied to individuals after infection has taken place. Under the concept of disease management these principles have been classified into following five categories: </p> <br>
            
      <ol>
           <li> Management of physical environment (cultural control)</li>
           <li>Management of associated micro biota (biological antagonism)</li>
           <li>Management of host genes (host resistance).</li>
           <li>Management with chemicals (Chemical control). </li>
           <li>Management with therapy (Physical, chemical etc).</li>
      </ol>   <br>
            
      <p>The six principles that characterize the modern concept of plant disease management should be viewed from three stand points</p> <br>
      <ol>
          <li> Reduction in the initial inoculums or the rate of disease development.</li>
          <li>Management of the pathogen population, the cure or induce defense of the susceptible host or modify the environment as it influences disease and </li>
          <li>Interruption of dispersal, survival or the course of disease development.</li>
       </ol>
